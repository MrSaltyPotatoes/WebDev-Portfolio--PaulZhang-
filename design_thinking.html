                <h2>Empathize</h2>
                <p>I started by thinking about the people who would visit my website. I asked myself: What would they want to know about me? I also looked at other portfolio websites to understand what works well. This helped me think from the user's point of view and focus on their needs.</p>

            <div class="process-text left">
                <h2>Define</h2>
                <p>After understanding the users, I clearly defined the goal of my website. I wanted it to introduce who I am clearly,and to highlight my personality and show my skills. I also wanted to make sure my website is easy to navigate and read.</p>

                <h2>Ideate</h2>
                <p>Once I had my goal, I started brainstorming. I made a list of pages and features I could include. I sketched out some layout ideas on paper and used color to demonstrate how the website would look. I also planned for images and icons to make the website more visual and interesting.</p>

            <div class="process-text left">
                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p>After planning, I built the first version of the website using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created a homepage with my name and photo, and added links to other sections. Short descriptions and layout are included. I also tried adding some interactive features like buttons that respond when you click them.</p>

            <div class="process-text right">
                <h2>Test</h2>
                <p>Finally, I asked a few classmates, friends, and family members to try my website. I asked them what features they like, and what do they want to adjust. I used their feedback to make improvementsâ€”like adjusting the font size, changing button styles, and making the navigation clearer.</p>

                <p>One of the challenge I meet is creating a scroll to up button - which is what I have not learnt from Microsoft Web Development Course.</p>

                    <li>I searched online, figured out which function can realize the effect</li>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Reflection</h2>
        <div class="reflection-container">
            <p>This is the first time I am asked to build a website on my own. At the beginning, I do not know what HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT really means. Only what I know is that all the websites I have visited is engaging, so I felt excited when developing the webpage.</p>
            
            <p>I started with HTML. It felt like building a house. I used tags like &lt;h1&gt; for titles and &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs. I also tried to add links and images. When I started to build my own website, I asked myself: What does the visitor need to see first? How can I make my web more attractive? I felt more and more confident when planning the layout of the website.</p>
            
            <p>Then I learned about CSS, which is the file that make my website looks beautiful. I used CSS to choose colors for my background and fonts I used for the webpage. I tried different background colors to see which one looks nice, and finally chose white as the background color. I changed the text size so it was easier to read, realizing that small changes can make a big difference.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, I started coding in JavaScript. This is the most challenging part, since the Microsoft Development Course did not talk about this topic a lot. I tried to make a button that provides more information about me after the user click it, however, it did not work, so I had to check my spelling and brackets. But when it finally worked, I felt a sense of accomplishment. I learned that debugging is part of coding.</p>
            
            <p>Through this whole process, I realized that design thinking is not only about being creative. It's about problem-solving. I had to think like the user. I kept testing and changing things. Sometimes I had to delete code and start again, but I didn't give up.</p>
            
            <p>Now that I finished my first ever webpage in my life, and I feel proud of myself. I learnt that anyone can code well if they are willing to try and overcome difficulties.</p>
