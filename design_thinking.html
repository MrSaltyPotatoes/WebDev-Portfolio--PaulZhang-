                <h2>Empathize</h2>
                <p>I started by thinking about the people who would visit my website. I asked myself: What would they want to know about me? I also looked at other portfolio websites to understand what works well. This helped me think from the user's point of view and focus on their needs.</p>

                <h2>Define</h2>
                <p>After understanding the users, I clearly defined the goal of my website. I wanted it to introduce who I am clearly,and to highlight my personality and show my skills. I also wanted to make sure my website is easy to navigate and read.</p>

                <h2>Ideate</h2>
                <p>Once I had my goal, I started brainstorming. I made a list of pages and features I could include. I sketched out some layout ideas on paper and used color to demonstrate how the website would look. I also planned for images and icons to make the website more visual and interesting.</p>

                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p>After planning, I built the first version of the website using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created a homepage with my name and photo, and added links to other sections. Short descriptions and layout are included. I also tried adding some interactive features like buttons that respond when you click them.</p>

            <div class="process-text right">
                <h2>Test</h2>
                <p>Finally, I asked a few classmates, friends, and family members to try my website. I asked them what features they like, and what do they want to adjust. I used their feedback to make improvementsâ€”like adjusting the font size, changing button styles, and making the navigation clearer.</p>
