                <h2>The Problem of Hunger</h2>
                <p>Hunger is still a big problem in many parts of the world. Though we are not suffering from hunger in Shanghai, it still happens around the world. Some people cannot get enough food, and children often suffer from poor nutrition. This makes it hard for them to grow, learn, or stay healthy. In some areas, hunger even leads to death. It causes pain and limits people's chances in life.</p>

                <h2>Why Zero Hunger Matters</h2>
                <p>The goal of Zero Hunger is important because food is a basic human need. Without enough food, people cannot go to school or work well. Reaching this goal also helps reduce poverty, improve health, and support peace. It connects to many other global goals and makes the world more fair.</p>

                <h2>Achieving the Goal</h2>
                <p>According to Target 2.1 and 2.2 of the Goal of Zero Hunger, <strong>UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD</strong> is achieved and people have to <strong>END ALL FORMS OF MALNUTRITION</strong>. To achieve this goal, we need to support farmers, reduce food waste, and share knowledge. Schools, governments, and communities should all work together. If we succeed, more people will be healthy and able to build better lives. A world without hunger brings hope, peace, and a better future for everyone.</p>
